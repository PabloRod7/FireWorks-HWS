Challenge

1 - For an easy challenge try adding a score label that updates as the playerâ€™s score changes.
2 - Make the game end after a certain number of launches. You will need to use the invalidate() method of Timer to stop it from repeating.
3 - Use the waitForDuration and removeFromParent actions in a sequence to make sure explosion particle emitters are removed from the game scene when they are finished.
